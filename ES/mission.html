              The environmental impact of food production is a challenge
              nowadays. Food systems have grown so complex, it is hard to solve
              one problem without making another one worse. Everything is
              connected. And these measures depress farmers’ incomes and cause
              hardship for smallholder farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our business is only focused on local eco-friendly and sustainable
              farms, all our marketing is directed to show people a viewpoint
              that emphasizes the interaction between access to nutrients and
              health and analyzes the effects of both undernutrition and
              obesity, that contributes to our environment.

          <p>
            Our approach is to show how the resource-efficient all-natural
            product is made. Especially the hard and intense work of
            environmentally focused farmers and technologists. It would be easy
            to mix together all cheap products, but we want to take people back
            to their roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technology is to use HPP machines, organic raw materials, the
            residue is reused to make other healthy products like sugar-free
            vegan cookies, muesli, fermented yogurt, and so on. We are working
            closely with the food technologists of Tallinn University of
            Technology to create a new technology for vegan drink.

            We have a trustworthy circle of local farmers as parters, Eesti
            Maheproteiini Ühistu and Tammejuure farm. Tammejuure Organic Farm is
            the most famous hemp farm in Estonia. They have been growing hemp
            for 10 years and have agriculture experience for over 30 years and
            cultivate crops on 600 hectares, organically certified since 2001.
          </p>
          <p>
            All production of the parters is based on bioenergy. Raw material is
            dried with a bio heater that uses wood chips from ditch bushes.
            Cereal terminal and food processing production is using solar energy
            from solar panels next to production facility.

            We are upfront and face the real problems that big dairy industries
            are creating. It’s not only harmful to animals (animal agriculture
            is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon rainforest destruction) but
            the numbers of the use of water and bait are terrifying. All this is
            creating problems, from the ignorance of people to climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we would reach 20 000 people in our first year, we would save 4
            million kg of CO2 emissions, 1.3 million kWh of energy and 1.2
            billion liters of water that cow milk is consuming right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have cut off all the unneccesary transporatation costs, that
            imported competitors have not made any effort on. Compared to the
            milk industry, they use 5,1 MJ/l of direct fossil energy and all
            together with indirect use of energy it takes 31,79 MJ to produce 1L
            of milk. EIMU uses 1,81 MJ of direct energy and intotal only 9,2 MJ
            to produce 1L of the drink.

            <h5>B vitamins</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>- thiamin</li>
              <li>- folate</li>

          <div class="right-side">
            <h5>High in fiber</h5>
            <p>
              Oat drink has twice the dietary fibre than cow’s milk making it an
              excellent choice for adding fibre to your diet for healthy gut and
              digestive functions. Specifically, beta glucan, a soluble fibre
              strengthens the immune system, regular consumption can prevent
              infection and improves the body’s ability to naturally heal
              itself.
            </p>
            <h5>High in vitamins</h5>
            <p>
              Oat drink contains B vitamins thiamine and folate, supporting the
              breakdown of carbohydrates (thiamine) for energy and normal
              function for red blood cells (folate).
            </p>
            <h5>Replaces Saturated fats with Unsaturated Fats</h5>
            <p>
              With zero saturated fats and a total of 2.5g of fat per serving,
              this is a super vegan milk product. Every day whole milk contains
              around 8g of fat and 5g of saturated fat. With minimal fat in each
              serving it makes oat drink very low in calories and perfect for
              those watching what they eat for their own training and dietary
              requirements.
            </p>
            <h5>Cholesterol Free</h5>
            <p>
              A dairy free product, oat drink contains zero cholesterol, regular
              consumption may even lower bad cholesterol (LDL) in the blood.
              Excessive cholesterol promotes build up of LDL or low-density
              lipoproteins in arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, a precursor
              of cardiovascular disease. So, for every serving of regular milk
              you replace with oat milk, you are reducing your daily cholesterol
              intake by 24mg.
            </p>
            <h5>Regulates Blood Sugar Levels</h5>
            <p>
              Beta glucan the soluble fibre slows down the absorption of
              carbohydrates in the gut, providing a slower and steadier supply
              of sugar into the blood stream. An excellent and very healthy
              choice for type 2 diabetes patients looking to help regulate their
              blood sugar.
            </p>
            <h5>Bone Strengthening Minerals</h5>
            <p>
              The minerals potassium, magnesium and zinc are all included in
              this super vegetable milk. All three minerals are important for
              micronutrients for the strengthening and formation of healthy
              bones.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="sides second">
          <div class="right-side">
            <h5>Improved heart health</h5>
            <p>
              This grain-like seed helps to reduce inflammation and lower LDL,
              or “bad cholesterol” levels, both of which are important for
              maintaining heart health. The primary nutrient that provides these
              cardiovascular benefits is rutin, a type of phytonutrient and
              antioxidant which helps stabilize blood pressure and reduce
              cholesterol.
            </p>
            <h5>Reduced blood sugar</h5>
            <p>
              In comparison to many whole grains, this pseudocereal is very low
              on the glycemic index – this means that the carbohydrate content
              is absorbed slowly into the blood stream, providing your body with
              a steady flow of energy. By preventing a sudden spike in blood
              sugar, this nutritious seed helps with diabetes management and may
              improve insulin resistance.
            </p>
            <h5>Gluten free and non-allergenic</h5>
            <p>
              Though it can be used in the same way as whole grains like wheat
              and barley, this seed is naturally gluten free, which makes it a
              great choice for people with celiac disease or grain
              sensitivities. Swapping this seed with typical grains containing
              gluten may also be helpful for people suffering from digestive
              disturbances like leaky gut syndrome.
            </p>
            <h5>Rich in dietary fiber</h5>
            <p>
              For every one cup serving of cooked groats, this food provides 6
              grams of dietary fiber. Dietary fiber helps to keep food moving
              smoothly through the digestive tract, and may help you feel fuller
              longer – this can be a benefit if you’re trying to lose weight.
            </p>
            <h5>Protects against cancer</h5>
            <p>
              This pseudocereal contains antioxidants and phenolic compounds,
              which may help to fight certain types of cancer. Some of the
              antioxidants found in this food include flavonoids like oligomeric
              proanthocyanidins, which protect your cells against free radical
              damage and prevent the kind of dangerous inflammation that can
              contribute to the spread of cancer.
            </p>
            <h5>Source of vegetarian protein</h5>
            <p>
              Not only is this food rich in vitamins and minerals, but it is an
              excellent source of digestible plant protein. For every 100 gram
              serving, this food contains as much as 14 grams of protein, and 12
              different amino acids to support growth and muscle synthesis. The
              protein content isn’t quite as high as certain beans and legumes,
              but it is higher than most whole grains.

            <h5>Improved immune system</h5>
            <p>
              Hemp seedx boast of Omega-3 and -6 fats in the ideal 1:3 ratio
              that promotes brain and heart health and is anti-inflammatory in
              the body.
            </p>
            <h5>May Reduce Your Risk of Heart Disease</h5>
            <p>
              The seeds contain high amounts of the amino acid arginine, which
              produces nitric oxide in your body. Nitric oxide is a gas molecule
              that makes your blood vessels dilate and relax, leading to lowered
              blood pressure and a reduced risk of heart disease.
            </p>
            <h5>May Benefit Skin Disorders</h5>
            <p>
              Studies have shown that giving hemp seed oil to people with eczema
              may improve blood levels of essential fatty acids. The oil may
              also relieve dry skin, improve itchiness and reduce the need for
              skin medication
            </p>
            <h5>Great Source of Plant-Based Protein</h5>
            <p>
              About 25% of calories in hemp seeds come from protein, which is
              relatively high. In fact, by weight, hemp seeds provide similar
              amounts of protein as beef and lamb — 30 grams of hemp seeds, or
              2–3 tablespoons, provide about 11 grams of protein. They are
              considered a complete protein source, which means that they
              provide all the essential amino acids. Your body cannot produce
              essential amino acids and must obtain them from your diet.
            </p>
            <h5>May Aid Digestion</h5>
            <p>
              Fiber is an essential part of your diet and linked to better
              digestive health. Whole hemp seeds are a good source of both
              soluble and insoluble fiber, containing 20% and 80%, respectively.
              Soluble fiber forms a gel-like substance in your gut. It’s a
              valuable source of nutrients for beneficial digestive bacteria and
              may also reduce spikes in blood sugar and regulate cholesterol
              levels. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool and may help food
              and waste pass through your gut. It has also been linked to a
              reduced risk of diabetes
