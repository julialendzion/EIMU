<h1>What's our Mission?</h1>
<div class="row"><img src="img/missionscheme.svg" alt="scheme" />
     <div>
     <p>The environmental impact of food production is a challenge nowadays. Food 
          systems have grown so complex, it is hard to solve one problem without 
          making another one worse. Everything is connected. And these measures depress 
          farmers’ incomes and cause hardship for smallholder farms. 
     </p><p>  Our business is only focused on local eco-friendly and sustainable farms, 
all our marketing is directed to show people a viewpoint that emphasizes the interaction 
between access to nutrients and health and analyzes the effects of both undernutrition and 
obesity, that contributes to our environment.   </p> </div>

<div class="side-text"><h2>Locally grown raw produce</h2>
<p class="mono">We support local agriculture and farmers & contribute to environmentally 
     friendly farming. </p>
<p> Our approach is to show how the resource-efficient all-natural product is made. 
     Especially the hard and intense work of environmentally focused farmers and technologists.
      It would be easy to mix together all cheap products, but we want to take people back to
       their roots.   </p><p>   The technology is to use HPP machines, organic raw materials, 
            the residue is reused to make other healthy products like sugar-free vegan cookies, 
            muesli, fermented yogurt, and so on. We are working closely with the food technologists 
            of Tallinn University of Technology to create a new technology for vegan drink.</p>

     <p class="mono">We support local agriculture and farmers and focus on choosing environmentally friendly farms </p>
     <p> We have a trustworthy circle of local farmers as parters,  Eesti Maheproteiini Ühistu and Tammejuure farm. Tammejuure Organic Farm is the most famous hemp farm in Estonia. They have been growing hemp for 10 years and have agriculture experience for over 30 years and cultivate crops on 600 hectares, organically certified since 2001.    </p><p>   All production of the parters is based on bioenergy. Raw material is dried with a bio heater that uses wood chips from ditch bushes. Cereal terminal and food processing production is using solar energy from solar panels next to production facility.</p>

          <p class="mono">First plant-based drink that is produced in Estonia and 100% local. </p>
          <p> In the next three years, we want to make a one-time investment to the technology needed (machines, enzymes, and rental space). Challenge is to find a fast and sustainable way how the process of making plant-based drinks that the product in stores is affordable for everyone.  </p><p>  Right now our parters are Maldivar and Värska, where we mill our grains & seeds and produce the drink.</p>

               <p class="mono">We care about our planet. </p>
               <p> We are upfront and face the real problems that big dairy industries are creating. It’s not only harmful to animals (animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon rainforest destruction) but the numbers of the use of water and bait are terrifying. All this is creating problems, from the ignorance of people to climate change.
               </p><p>   If we would reach 20 000 people in our first year, we would save 4 million kg of CO2 emissions, 1.3 million kWh of energy and 1.2 billion liters of water that cow milk is consuming right now.  </p> <p> We have cut off all the unneccesary transporatation costs, that imported competitors have not made any effort on. 

                    Compared to the milk industry,  they use 5,1 MJ/l of direct fossil energy and all together with indirect use of energy it takes 31,79 MJ to produce 1L of milk. EIMU uses 1,81 MJ of direct energy and intotal only 9,2 MJ to produce 1L of the drink. <ul class="sources"> <li> 1. (Eesti Maaülikool 2012 ) “Energia põllumajanduses”
